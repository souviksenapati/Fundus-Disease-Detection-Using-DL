# Glaucoma Detection System using YOLOv8 & Flask

**Introduction**

In the field of ophthalmology, early detection of Glaucoma‚Äîa leading cause of irreversible blindness‚Äîis critical. However, manual examination of fundus images and videos to determine the Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR) is time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we present an AI-powered solution: **Glaucoma Detection System using YOLOv8 & Flask**. This project leverages the power of Deep Learning to analyze fundus images and videos, accurately compute the CDR, and predict the risk of Glaucoma in real-time. Built with Flask and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, this user-friendly system aims to assist ophthalmologists and researchers in efficient, automated diagnosis.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install flask
pip install ultralytics
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install numpy
pip install torch
pip install pykalman
```

Note: If you're using a lightweight machine or Hugging Face Space, it's recommended to use opencv-python-headless instead of opencv-python.

## Features

### üñºÔ∏è Fundus Image & Video Analysis
- Accepts input in the form of `.jpg`, `.png` (images) or `.mp4`, `.avi` (videos).
- Automatically detects **optic disc** and **optic cup** regions using **YOLOv8**.
- Calculates the **Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR)** for each frame (in case of videos).
- Applies **Kalman Filtering** to smooth predictions across frames.
- Generates a final **CDR value** and provides a **Glaucoma Risk Diagnosis**:
  - ‚úÖ **CDR < 0.4** ‚Üí *Healthy*
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CDR 0.4 - 0.5** ‚Üí *Risk Detected* (percentage shown)
  - ‚ùå **CDR ‚â• 0.5** ‚Üí *Glaucoma Detected*

---

### üåê Web Interface
- Built using **Flask**, **HTML5**, and **Bootstrap**.
- Upload form with **loader animation** and **progress bar**.
- **Dynamic result display** with color-coded health tags.
- Fully optimized for deployment on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

---

### üß† Model
- Trained on real-world annotated **fundus datasets**.
- Deployed using **CPU-safe PyTorch + YOLOv8** pipeline.
- Enhanced with **Kalman Filter** to reduce prediction noise.
